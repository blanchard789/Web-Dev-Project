# Project Report

### 11/23/25:

- Created and pushed the following files

```
assets/
    with some icon files for previous projects
scripts/
    main.js
styles/
    styles.css
index.html
README.md
ProjectReport.md
```

Mostly just trying to get the repo and project setup. Assets will be a folder for image files needed for the website. Scripts will be a folder for any eventual JavaScript files. Styles will be a folder for any cascading style sheets used in this website. Index.html is the main page for the website. ProjectReport.md will be for required class updates such as this one.

- Created prototype nav bar

Copied nav bar from class homework exercise. I also modified it a bit, including adding my own colors. I will need to go back later and work on it some more, but it's a good enough starting point.

### 11/24/25

- Created section elements for all 4 required sections. Set up some early css formating for them as well.

- Updated nav bar to support smaller screens. On mobile and tablet screens nav buttons are replaced with selection box to save space, using media queries.

- Started add some info the created section elements.

### 11/25/25

- Further refined css formatting for required information sections. Such as adding borders and changing some rows to columns for better use of space and formatting.
